To install this, put it in your ~/.Natron directory.
** AddMix.py
A merge node that outputs Aa + B(1-a) (unpremultiplied over) with curves so you can separately adjust the Aa and (1-a) values. Good for compositing transluscent light sources like flames, sunbeams, white smoke, steam etc. This is a Pyplug and to install it you place it in your OFX Plugin directory.
